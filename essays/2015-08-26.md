  I have decided to become an MIS major after talking to professionals and joining some student clubs such as BEST. Just by talking to people I was able to obtain insight into the benefits of being both a Finance and MIS major in the rapidly changing world. I hope to learn more about programming in this ITM 352 class and I hope to have fun doing so!
